<h3>About Me</h3>

<p>
I enjoy spending time around animals and noticing the funny things they do.
This morning, I saw a dog jump over a fence and chase after a cat, which was
both surprising and amusing to watch. Moments like that make me appreciate how
energetic and unpredictable animals can be. In general, I like observing nature,
learning new things, and relaxing when I can.
